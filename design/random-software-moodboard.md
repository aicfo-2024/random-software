## Color Palette: Austin FC Green + Warm Coral

### Primary Colors
- **Austin FC Green**: `#00B140`
  - Use for: Hover states, active navigation, accent lines, CTA buttons
  - Energy: Fresh, vibrant, tech-forward, Austin identity
  
- **Warm Coral**: `#FF6B5A`
  - Use for: Secondary CTAs, highlights, link underlines, occasional pops
  - Energy: Playful, creative, approachable, warm

### Supporting Colors
- **Base/Background**: `#FAFAFA` or `#F8F8F8` (soft off-white)
- **Text**: `#2C2C2C` or `#333333` (dark gray, not pure black)
- **Subtle Borders**: `#E5E5E5` (light gray for dividers when needed)

### Color Usage Philosophy
- **90% neutral** (white/gray) to create gallery atmosphere
- **10% accent colors** (green + coral) for intentional moments
- Green = primary action/navigation
- Coral = secondary emphasis/personality
- Both colors pop beautifully against white space

## Visual Style References

### Gallery Aesthetics
**Key Sites to Study:**
- **Rachel Uffner Gallery** - Grid layout with generous white space, art takes center stage
- **David Kordansky Gallery** - Full-width visuals, bold typography, minimal color scheme
- **National Gallery (UK)** - Centered layout, generous whitespace, modern touches
- **Mauritshuis** - Horizontal scrolling, striking color use (white/black/pink)
- **5 Art Gallery** - Bold black-and-white with vibrant work popping through

**What to Emulate:**
- Large white space around each "exhibit" (project)
- Clean navigation that gets out of the way
- High-quality visuals as the focal point
- Minimal decorative elements
- Simple, elegant typography hierarchy

### Developer Portfolio Minimalism
**Key Examples:**
- **Alex Carpenter** - Narrow single-column layout, minimal menu items
- **Delba** - Project-based, delightful animations (Rough Notation library)
- **Lily Stockman** - All-white design with colorful work as focal point
- **Harry Atkins** - Clean grid, monochromatic with strategic color pops

**What to Emulate:**
- Single-column layouts that don't require mobile collapse
- Focus on projects, not interface chrome
- "Selected Work" approach (curation over exhaustion)
- Subtle animations that add delight without distraction
- Philosophical descriptions that explain the "why"

### Color Inspiration
**Green + Coral Combinations:**
- Tropical Oasis palette - vibrant but balanced
- RHS website - earthy greens with coral CTAs
- Nature-inspired palettes - sage green + terracotta/coral
- Tech startup aesthetics - energetic coral, calming mint/green

**What Works:**
- Coral/warm tones draw attention without overwhelming
- Green grounds the design, adds sophistication
- Both work beautifully on white/light backgrounds
- Create warm/cool temperature contrast
- Feel fresh, modern, energetic without being childish

## Typography Direction

### Font Recommendations (Technical but Accessible)
**Primary Options:**
- **Space Grotesk** - Geometric but friendly, great for tech
- **Inter** - Clean, highly readable, modern standard
- **Untitled Sans** - Sophisticated, minimal, professional
- **ABC Diatype** - Editorial quality, slightly quirky

### Hierarchy
- **Hero/Project Titles**: 60-80px (desktop)
- **Section Headers**: 32-48px
- **Body Text**: 16-18px
- **Small Text/Captions**: 14px

### Principles
- Large size differences for clear hierarchy
- Generous line-height (1.5-1.7 for body)
- Ample letter-spacing on headings
- No need for monospace since no code blocks

## Layout & Structure Principles

### Gallery-First Approach
1. **Massive white space** - Projects breathe, never cramped
2. **Single-column flow** - Vertical scroll, linear experience
3. **Each project = exhibition piece** - Title, description, visual
4. **Asymmetric layouts encouraged** - Not everything centered
5. **Generous vertical spacing** - 80-120px between sections

### Navigation
- **Fixed minimal header** - Name + 3-4 menu items max
- **Unobtrusive** - Thin, light, doesn't compete with content
- **Green accent on active/hover** states
- **Options**: 
  - Top: "Alex Witt" (left) | "Work / Personal / Writing / About" (right)
  - Alternative: Hidden hamburger that reveals clean menu

### Project Card Structure (for homepage)
Each project gets its own section with:
- **Large preview image** (or screenshot)
- **Project title** (large, bold)
- **One-line description** (philosophical "why")
- **Subtle link indicator** (arrow or "View Project →")
- **Tag/category** (small, maybe with color coding)

### Exhibition Sections
- **"Work"** - Professional/airCFO projects
- **"Personal"** - Side projects and experiments
- Later: **"Writing"** and **"Podcast"** sections

## Interaction Design

### Subtle Animation Examples
- **Gentle fade-ins** on scroll
- **Hover state changes** on project cards (slight scale or opacity shift)
- **Smooth color transitions** (200-300ms)
- **Underline animations** on links (slide in from left)
- **Cursor changes** to indicate clickability
- **NO**: Heavy parallax, bouncing, spinning, or jarring movements

### Hover States
- **Links**: Coral underline slides in
- **Project cards**: Slight lift (2-4px) + subtle shadow
- **Buttons**: Background color fill (green or coral)
- **Images**: Slight opacity change or scale
